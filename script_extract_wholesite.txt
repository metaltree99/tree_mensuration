create_tabs_despite_additional_data=0 #0=no, 1=yes. For test only. Will create tabulated files (turn additional_data to 0) for germplasms and germplasms_on_sites even if measurements and/or coded observations are already present in TreeSource (additional_data=1).
skip="no" # yes, no: skip most of the script. Look for SKIP_TAG below.

test=2 #Test mode: 1. yes 2. no
#	If in test mode, stops after 10 analyzed columns for validation, and displays more progress details on screen.
no_network=1 # 1 = true (no network is available), 2 = false (network P and U drives are available)


#**********TODO**********:
	#Make the "disable_trigger" and "enable_trigger" functions standalone scripts
	#ALSO: See "Modifications", 20130830
#**************************:


#Usage:
	#bash script_extract_wholesite.txt sitefile 
	
	#1. sitefile [REQUIRED]: the file containing site info
		#See sheet "Markers_for_wholesites_imports" of file ADDED.xls for required info in that file.


#For testing with ts_d
#	DELETE from coded_observations_on_germplasms where ri_date >= '2015-01-23';
#	DELETE from tree_mensurations where ri_date >= '2015-01-23';
#	DELETE from observations_on_sites where ri_date >= '2015-01-23';
#	DELETE from observation_codes where ri_date >= '2015-01-23';

#Modifications:
	#20120118: 	minor correction when SEQUENCE column is <> 0
	# 		added formatting into final utf8 files (step 13)
	#20120119: 	improved final files handling (naming)
	#		added uniformization of col number right after file cleaning to prevent some "Excel-last-column-sometimes-empty-sometimes-not"-related errors
	#20120120:	Removed 0-value observations when zero_ignored is specified in REQ_data_types.txt
	#20120124:	Added a module to check for inconsistency in measurements through time (e.g. decreasing height values)
	#20120127:	minor correction to SQL scripts signaling measurement errors.
	#		All required files including scripts are now in the folder specified by the req_files_folder variable
	#20120209:	Now puts all generated files and folders into a folder named after the site code
	#		Now checks for all specified date formats
	#20120210:	Now allows each tree to have a different species (abbreviation listed in REQ_species_codes.txt) when a SPECIES column exists and get organisms.id from all_organisms.txt
	#20120213:	Now replaces commas with periods for measurement columns (lines 1415 and 1417).
	#20120309: 	Major overhaul of tree status (E) handling, used to consider or not other coded observations (F, D, RT, QT, etc.) 
	#			- Observation codes (E, F, D, etc.) from different organizations (CFS, MRNF) can be used
	#			- Organization must be specified in the parameters as: data_origin=1 (CFS) or 2 (MRNF)
	#			- the NORMAL (living) TREE STATUS can have several values instead of only one.
	#			- reject_obs_when_abnormal_tree_status is now specified in the parameters 
	#			- If reject_obs_when_abnormal_tree_status is set to 
	#				1: the script will keep only other coded observations (F, D, RT, RQ, etc.) when tree is NORMAL (e.g. alive)
	#				2: the script will keep other coded observations EVEN if the tree as an ABNORMAL STATUS (e.g. dead, cut, or filler tree)
	#20120312:	
	#			Minor correction: When keeping other observations (e.g. F, D, QT, RT, etc.) for all values of E, the script was wrongfully excluding other observations when E was 1.
	#			Now removes coded observations if that have an empty values, before further processing. Beforehand, those values were wrongfully treated as different from no_msmt_value (e.g. 0) and this would mess up things when identifying which years had observation values <> 0 (or any other no_msmt_value).
	#			The program now checks from what machine (domain name) it is executed and finds the proper way to the P: itself. It can then be run from BioLinux or any other machine PROVIDED IT IS ON THE LOCAL NETWORK.
	#20120313: The final folder regrouping all files at the end is now timestamped
	#20120404: added the reading direction, with possible values in REQ_other_codes.txt
	#20120410: 		reading_direction added to REQ_reference_measurement_units.txt, and the possibility to add comments with #
	#			Non-numerical fields for tree_mensurations no longer have conversion of units
	#20120416		Now removes lines with field values specified in the file: REQ_values_to_remove.txt. This is done prior to field validations, and the changes are permanent.
	#20120417		REQ_required_fields.txt and REQ_optional_fields.txt are now joined into REQ_germplasm_name_fields.txt, and deal only with germplasms fields
	#			REQ_data_types.txt now contains columns for destination table (#13) and destination column (#14).
	#			With this, possible fields from germplasms_on_sites are now extracted directly from REQ_data_types.txt
	#20120418: Now checks for measurements with empty units.
	#20120713: Another BIG improvement of tree status (E) handling.
	#			Now, for each tree status, we can specify which observation(s) are allowed to be considered, by listing them in the REQ_tree_status_and_allowed_observations.txt file
	#			For example, QcE=2 status gives access to all other observations (QcD, QcMfm, QcRgbp, etc.)...
	#			...whereas QcE=1 status permits only QcD observations to be kept, and QcE=0 allows NO other observations.
	#20120716: Tiny correction on line #1042 to avoid error messages by validate_columns.txt when it was receiving units containing spaces, even if the field was to be ignored: units=$(echo $units|perl -pe 's/ //g') 
	#20120802:  Added a column with descriptions of each code in REQ_tree_status_and_allowed_observations.txt. This column is removed before using the file, with a "cut -f1-3" added at line line 1554.
	#		Also, trees with E5 CFS code (filler trees) are now allowed to have any observations in REQ_tree_status_and_allowed_observations.txt
	#20130221: Now initially ignores (Section 3A, 3C) during validation any value in the date column if it doesn't containt at least 2 consecutive digits. This avoids errors signalling when "-" were entered, even for fields not requiring a date.
	#20130225:	Creates a SQL script to insert comments on the trees on which observations (e.g. illnesses) were made while tree status was abnormal (dead, missing, etc.).
	#20130226: 
	#		While preparing tree mensurations, also replace empty values with NULL. Prior to this, only 0's were replaced by NULLs.
	#		Create SQL INSERT commands to add observations on sites when aberrant (i.e. decreasing) measurements were found.
	#		Now also copies a list of example SQL commands into the SQL_OTHER_COMMANDS_EXAMPLE.txt file, in the final_files folder.
	#20130320:
	#		REQ_obs_codes_other_than_tree_status.txt is no longer a required file. It is now extracted directly from REQ_data_types.txt
	#20130321:
	#		Major module added: substitution of values directly in the cleaned file, or in the final tabulated file, depending on the option chosen.
	#		Substitutions are listed in REQ_site-specific_values_substitution_utf.txt and can be site- and/or year-specific,.
	#			1. substitution before validation (e.g. codes for damages will be substituted from 11 to 7) - the substituted value must comply with validation rules. 
	#			2. substitution after validation (e.g. FAMPROV from 99999 TO XXXXX) - the substituted value is not submitted to validation rules, caution must be exercised.
	#			3. substitution in the final tabulated file (e.g. code F_7 ---> code F_7d) - the substituted value is checked against all existing codes from TreeSource in the observation_codes table, and if it doesn't exist, SQL commands are automatically created to insert it.
	#		Now gets observation final codes in real time from TreeSource. They are used to validate the existence or not of substitution codes.
	#		Now regroups all SQL commands (insert, update) into 2 clean scripts.
	#20130322:	Now checks and warns if replicated compartments are found.
	#20130325:
	#		Now counts the number of substitutions and lists them.
	#20130328:
	#		Now can automatically import the final tabulated data + SQL scripts into the development and production databases
	#20130402:	Now automatically generates a journal file
	#20130408: Line 1059: grep "0$" ---CORRECTED TO---> grep "[[:space:]]0$", because it was grabbing not only 0, but any other number ending by 0 (e.g. 10, 20) as well.
	#20130409:
	#		Now can choose in the parameters file to select the sub-block number instead of the block number to generate the tree name
	#			A comment is added to observations on sites when this is the case.
	#		For sites without sequence numbers, the all trees get a name with "00000" for sequences.
	#		Corrected replicated lines in value_substitutions_for_current_site_3_on_final_tabulated_file.txt when there were several columns of the same observation type (e.g. "D") for any given year.
	#		File encoding check and UTF-8 conversion is now done by a called function
	#20130410:
	#		Fixes to incorrect encoding of some files (partly iso-8859-1, partly utf-8)
	#		Infile and parameters files are now copied and converted to utf-8. The original files are left intact.
	#		NOW, the whole script is in UTF-8 to avoid encoding errors due to variables or strings with accents from the script (previously iso-8859-1) that were collated with other utf-8 files.
	#20130416:	
	#		Now can accomodate different generation methods for trees (e.g. germination, cuttings) with the header marker GEN_METH
	#		Columns with varying values are extracted and later reassembled for the germplasms tabulated file 
	#20130417:	Minor correction to fnct_replace_headers
	#20130424:	validation_data.txt is not put into the final_files folder for convenience.
	#20130425:  All lines removed  according to the criteria specified in REQ_values_to_remove.txt are now shown on screen.
	#20130827: Number of characters for the fam/prov number in the tree names is now specified in parameters_script_extract_wholesites
	#20130828: Corrected the check of existing SQL_insert_saved_errors* files, as an error was occuring with the following syntax:
		#	if [ -s ${temp_f}/SQL_insert_saved_errors* ]
		#	Now replaced with:
		#	if [ $(ls -1 ${temp_f}|grep 'SQL_insert_saved_errors'|wc -l) -gt 0 ]
		#	Also did the same for the 'SQL_update_meas*' files.
	#20130829: minor correction: copying the parameters file now uses a wildcard (*).
		#	Observation codes change: "M" is now "D", "MARKED" is now "MAR"
	#20130830
		#	Now extracts automatically the list of observation codes from TreeSource.
		#	Corrections in SQL scripts and tabulated files to accomodate the new germplasm_name ---> germplasm_id structure.
		#	NOTE: THE alternative_germplasm_name STILL HAS TO BE CORRECTED TO ACCOMODATE THIS NEW STRUCTURE
	#20130903
		#	Corrections of header names in final files generation. 
		#	Addition of temp_date_named in 2insert_01_germplasms_utf.txt.
		#	Now checks that every family/provenance number is not longer than the max specified in famprovchars
		#	#TREE: separation in two files:
		#		TREE.txt 				--->for germplasms_on_sites.tree_number. 	No change in the original file. If an integer, will be imported as is. If NULL, it will be automatically replaced by a \N in the tabulated file for import.
		#		TREE_left-padded.txt: 	---> for germplasm_names.name. 			If TREE is a number, will be left-padded. If anything else, will be replaced by "XXX".
	#20140310
		#	Correction of INSERT INTO observations_codes... 
		#	SQL_insert_and_update3.txt now has specific data_source_id and site_code
	#20140311
		#	The script now disables the trigger trg_germplasms_on_sites_03 before inserting data into germplasms_on_sites, to avoid it running forever. It re-enables it after.
	#20140312
		#	Now checks the format (digits vs other characters) of the family/provenance numbers
		#	Trigger disabling/enabling function has been refined.
	#20140313
		#	Now directly inserts germplasm names instead of germplasm ids in comments_on_germplasms, due to the newly (today) created trigger (trg_comments_on_germplasms_01) and trigger function (proc_insert_into_comments_on_germplasms_using_germplasm_names).
	#20140325
		#	all sort commands on tabulated files (>1 fields) now have the option: -t $'\t'
		#	This was necessary to prevent an error occuring when running this in the tabulated files generation of coded_observations_on_germplasms, line:
		#		join -t $'\t' <(grep -v '^#' ${req_files_folder}/REQ_obs_codes_conv_table2_sel_codes.txt |grep "^${obs_type}[[:space:]]" |cut -f2,3|sort -t $'\t' -k1,1) ${temp_f}/${temp_fileC} ...
		#		...as temp_fileC often contained empty values in the first, joining column, raising error: "extract_whole_sites_temp/E_tempC_sorted_by_obs.txt:863: is not sorted"
	#20140328
		#	No longer re-enables the trg_germplasms_on_sites_03 at the end of inserts, to avoid it happening in the middle of an insert in germplasms_on_sites by another instance of the same script, running in parallel.
	#20140708
		#	replaced site_code with temp_site_code to accomodate the new structure (PK: sites.code ===> sites.id). Also see: SQL20140626_change_site_code_for_site_id.txt
	#20140912
		#	Now reads site parameters directly from the Excel file, and validates them (name, value, format) using the file REQ_parameters_default_values_and_types_utf.txt
		#	Also checks if site code and data_source_id exist in the DB
		#	Also extracts plantation_date from DB
	#20140926
		#	Now automatically adds replicated compartment numbers whenever there are replicated block-family/provenance-tree combinations
		#	Does this for all replicated compartements except those from filler trees, which the script asks the user to identify
		#	Woooweee!
	#20150106
		#	Completed the automated replicated compartment detection block.
		#	Changed the team_code to team_id references, and allowed the use of employees full names in the file team_employees_per_date.txt (formerly team_codes_per_date.txt), and in the parameter plantation_team_employees.
	#20150113
		#	No more test_mode chosen as a parameter when executing the script
		#	Reject_obs_when_abnormal_tree_status value comes solely from the parameters. I used to be overwritten by line ~ 299.
		#	Trigger inactivation/reactivation is no longer done
		#	Now gets required files from ${ref_files_path_shared} (U:/Centre_Fibre/NationalWoodFibreAttributesDatabase/Partage/scripts/ref_files)
	#20150114
		#	Extracted the line removal based on certain values part from section "9. Create a cleaned file" to create "12. Remove lines based on certain field values". 
		#		Reason is to wait until after the replicated compartment check section (#11) has performed, because both use the all_possible_fields_pos.txt file, modified by 11.
		#	Some files extracted on-the-fly from TreeSource by the script and stored in ${req_files_folder} are now stored under ${temp_f}
		#		${req_files_folder}/REQ_obs_codes_conv_table2_all_codes.txt				--->	${temp_f}/Phenotree_all_obs_codes_and_descriptions.txt
		#		${req_files_folder}/REQ_data_source_ids_in_DB.txt						--->	${temp_f}/Phenotree_data_source_ids.txt
		#		${req_files_folder}/REQ_sites_code_and_plantation_dates_and_year_in_DB.txt		---> 	${temp_f}/Phenotree_sites_code_and_plantation_dates_and_years.txt
	#20150115
		#	Now checks existing measurement and coded observation years in TreeSource.
		#		If they exist, it means that data has already been imported for that site in the past. The following variable is set: additional_data=1
		#			It also means that records for germplasms and germplasms_on_sites have also been imported in the past as well, so tabulated files for those won't be generated.
		#		Also compares existing years in TreeSource vs Excel file for those measurements and coded observations
		#			If same years found for coded observations, offers choice to try to import nevertheless: if exactly same DATE and codes, will fail at INSERT. If not will work.
		#			If same years found for measurements, aborts, because it would fail at insert time.

	#20150116
		#	Now make a copy of critical (those to which lines are regularly added) required files on the P
	#20150122
		#	Now gets the local_network_paths.txt file from $HOME, whatever the operating system (Windows 7, BioLinux, on which the script is 
		#	The file local_network_paths.txt must now be put in /home/username for all computers where the script can be run, including computer for students or other hired employees.
		#	Note that this file will not be the same for the admin (seclemen) and other users, as well as the script_general_variables.txt file.
		#	Backup of user-modified required files is now done on the U instead of the P, avoiding problems when other users run the script.
	#20150123
		#	Convert site code to uppercase before checking it vs database.
		#	Now skips the check for replicated compartments section if data already exists in germplasms_on_sites (additional_data=1).
		#	Corrected validation_data.txt: generated from SQL_extract_data_for_validation.txt, which previously was extracting random trees based on data_source_id, but thus generated empty results when only tree_mensurations and/or coded_observations_on_germplasms were inserted.
		#		...now based on site_code search of germplasm_names.
	#20150210
		#	Doesn't use the external script script_insert_wholesite.txt anymore. It is now replaced by the function: fnct_auto_insert_main_tab_files
		#	fnct_auto_insert_in_db ==renamed==> fnct_auto_insert_all_in_db
	#20150227
		#	Now extracts each time all_organisms.txt, to ensure an up-to-date version if a SPECIES column is present.

	#20150525
		#	L'ajout d'une fonction pour calculer l'annÈe de croissance rÈellement mesurÈe ‡ partir de la date de mesurage est inutile, 
		#		car cette fonction est maintenant intÈgrÈe directement dans TreeSource. Voir: SQL20150521_add_growth_year_calc_to_tree_mensurations.txt
		#	Cependant, certains champs ont d˚ Ítre renommÈs (ligne 3749): date ---> msmt_date, year ---> msmt_year

	#20160713
		#	The no_network variable allows to indicate if the P/U network drives are available, and if not, use local files instead.
		#	This was intended to overcome problems on BioLinux which now accesses the network drives erratically.

	#20160719
		#	xtraksites132.156.208.45.txt is now included in the required files under REQs_script_extract_wholesite.
		#	Section 9: cleaned file creation: modified code to get rid of lines even when they contain regular spaces or tabls (grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$').
		#	Section 23C. coded_observations_on_germplasms: now provides more explainations as to why the script is stopped when no E column could be found along other observations (e.g. D, F) of the same date.
		#	team_employees_per_date.txt is now produced under extract_whole_sites_temp.
		#	logging  is now done to ${ready2import_tabs_folder}/extract_sites_log.txt
	
	#20160728
		#	New section 5.A. that verifies the REQ_site-specific_values_substitution_utf.txt file values right after obtaining site parameters from the file (Section 5).
		#	(previously, there was some validations in section 18. (Prepare files for value substitutions before or after validation) C, D and G. These are now gone.
		#	The new section checks each column from REQ_site-specific_values_substitution_utf.txt to ensure that:
		#		Col 1: each site code exists. Note: current site code existence was confirmed in section 5.
		#		Col 2: data type (header) exists in REQ_data_types.txt.
		#		Col 3: year is valid.
		#		Col 4: original value (to be substituted):
		#			Option 1 (values to be substituted before validation): not verified, too many possible, often erraneous values.
		#			Option 2 (values to be substituted after validation): not verified, too many possible values.
		#			Option 3 (values to be substituted in tabulated file): value must be an observation code and must exist in TreeSource.
		#		Col 5: modified value
		#			Option 1 (values to be substituted before validation): value must be an observation code and must exist in TreeSource.
		#			Option 2 (values to be substituted after validation): not verified, too many possible values.
		#			Option 3 (values to be substituted in tabulated file): value is not verified, because may not exist yet in TreeSource (to be created during script execution, in Section 18).
		#		Col 6: must be: 1, 2 or 3.

		#A new parameter, tree_name_format, specifies the tree name format output, and the fields required to calculate this name.
		#	There are 3 formats right now:
		#		S_B_F_T_S: the most standard format, Site code, block #, family/provenance #, compartment tree #, sequence #
		#			Example: E410D2_05_00425_002_06194_00
		#		S_B_BR_BC_F: Site_code, block #, block row #, block col #, family/provenance #
		#			Example: E188B_1_11_4_134_5
		#		S_B_F_T_C: Site_code, block #, family/provenance #, compartment tree #, compartment #
		#			Example: SLC30498_14_20921_003_0750
		#A check is done around lines 2093+ to see if the fields present in the Excel file match the requested format. If not, the script warns and exits.
		#When calculating the tree name, most fields used are now left-padded using the max number of digits encountered in all numeric values of these fields, rather than on a fixed number. See lines 3360+
		#Use_subblock_in_tree_name is no longer used as a parameter, as the tree name format is specified in the tree_name_format parameter above.


	#20210708
		#For tree name generation, a first section determines automatically the max number of digits for each field (e.g. max_digits_block_field) based on the values in the file
		#Then for each name format, that automatically generated value, or a manually-set value, is chosen to left-pad the values.

	#20210709
